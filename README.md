## A Simple Blockchain written in Javascript using Node.js
The pupose of me starting this project is to demonstrate the implementation of Blockchain technology and to help the community understand this revolutionary tech in a practicle way.

### This Blockchain application currently has the ability to:
1. Perform a proof of work to secure the blockchain <br />
2. Create new blocks through a mining process <br />
3. Create new, immutable transactions <br />
4. Validate the entire blockchain and all of the data within each block <br />
5. Retrieve address/transaction/block data <br />
6. API foudnation with endpoints. <br />
7. Decentralized network with multiple nodes <br />

### Installed npm Libraries (Exp. npm i sha256 --save)
1. sha256  <br />
2. express <br />
3. nodemon : restart our server automatically when we make changes <br />
4. body-parser <br />
5. uuid : create an unique random network node address string <br />
6. request <br />
7. request-promise : make request to all other nodes in the network <br />
