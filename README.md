## This Blockchain application demonstrate the ability to:
1. Perform a proof of work to secure the blockchain <br />
2. Create new blocks through a mining process <br />
3. Create new, immutable transactions <br />
4. Validate the entire blockchain and all of the data within each block <br />
5. Retrieve address/transaction/block data <br />
6. API foudnation with endpoints <br />
7. Decentralized network with multiple nodes <br />
8. Synchronized Network, means it has only a single version of Blockchain across nodes <br />
9. Consense the Blockchain via Consensus Algorithms.
10. To search and display specific block, transaction and address.
